# Wave Analysis Toolbox
---
## Description:
This MATLAB GUI program was developed as my term project for the course OE4080. It analyzes an ocean wave timeseries and gives various parameters.

---
## Prerequisites:
1. MATLAB
2. MATLAB App Designer (Mostly already included in a vanilla MATLAB installation)
3. Signal Processing Toolbox
4. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

---
## Inputs:
- Wave timeseries should be a **.csv** file.
- Long-term Wave height file should be **.nc**, with the wave height column marked as **VAVH**

---
## Outputs:
- Graph of time vs. sea surface variation
- Up and down zero crossing parameters
- Energy Density Spectrum
- Paramters calculated from the spectrum
- Probability Distribution Function of the Sea Surface Elevation
- Probability Distribution Function of the Wave Heights
- Long-term Probability Distribution Function for a macro-scale wave height file.

---
## Execution:
Open the **WAT.mlapp** file in MATLAB to run the program.
